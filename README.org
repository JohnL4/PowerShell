* PowerShell

  PowerShell scripts.  Most of these scripts should have usable documentation at the head of the script, so look there
  for info on each one.

  These files should be copied to ~/Documents/PowerShell (or ~/Documents/WindowsPowerShell, if you're still using the old PowerShell).

* Scripts Of Note

** =top2.ps1=

   A gruesome hack providing an approximation of the functionality available in the *nix =top(1)= command.

   Uses Windows Performance Counters to sample process stats, sorting them in various ways (CPU, Working Set, Page
   Faults/sec, IO Bytes/sec), and also showing overall system stats (Idle CPU %, Available Megabytes, Page Faults/sec,
   Physical Disk Queue Length, IP Datagrams/sec).
